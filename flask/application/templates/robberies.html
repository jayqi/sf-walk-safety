        <p>
            Robberies are crimes of taking possessions by force or threat of force. Here, we consider street-level cases of robbery that involve pedestrians, such as muggings. Using open data from the San Francisco Police department, we visualize street robbery incidents since 2003 and examine their prevalence.
        </p>
        <p>
            From 2003 through 2015, there were a total of 24,889 street robbery reports, for an average of 5.2 in the city each day. In the adjacent figure, we see the total number of reported street robbery incidents each year from 2003 to 2015. The number of yearly reports of robberies peaked in 2006 and then as since generally been decreasing.

        Below are some detailed analysis of how robberies relate to other variables. Unless otherwise specified, the analysis in this section only considers robbery reports from 2003 through 2015, where we have full years.

            <p>The adjacent histogram shows (normalized) frequency of robberies by hour of the day. We can see that there is quite a strong daily pattern. The least number of robberies happen during the morning commute hours, while the most happen around midnight.</p>
            <p>Plotted as a dark blue curve is a temporal probability distribution model for the robberies, generated using kernel density estimation. This distribution predicts the likelihood that, if we consider a robbery, when during the day that it occurs.</p>

            <p>It seems that there tends to be slightly more robberies in the late summer, while fewer in the winter. However, the difference is fairly small, especially compared to the amount of variation across years.</p>
