            Plots showing averaged monthly totals for thefts and robberies, respectively. The envelope shows the standard deviation.

        <p>
            Thefts and robberies appear to occur at a higher rate during summer months than winter months.

        <h2>Time of Day Distribution</h2>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>
            Histograms showing respectively theft incidents and robbery incidents binned by hour of the day. Also plotted are probability density functions estimated using gaussian kernel density estimation. The so-called Silverman's rule for optimal bandwidth choice is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thefts are most frequent in the afternoon and evening, with a smaller second peak at late hours of the night. Their least frequent time is the early hours of the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, robberies are at their least frequent in the late morning and at their most frequent in the late hours of the night.

        <h2>Spatial Distribution</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>
            Contour plots of spatial probability density functions from kernel density estimates for thefts and robberies, respectively. Red means that a higher probability that a theft or robbery incident would be at that geographic location. Kernel density estimates were generated with Gaussian kernels and a bandwidth chosen by Silverman's Rule.
