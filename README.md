## Walking in San Francisco

Walking is a common part of living in San Francisco. According to the SFMTA, over one million walking trips happen in the city each dayâ€”over a quarter of all trips. Walking is an important component to a healthy lifestyle, and it is a great way to get to know the city intimately.

This project takes a look at open government crime and traffic collision data relevant to pedestrian safety in the city. Three classes of incidents are examined: thefts, robberies, and traffic collisions. We present interactive maps and visualizations to inform residents about these incidents in their city. We also use statistical analysis and machine learning to gain deeper insights and model the patterns underlying these incidents.

This project was developed as part of [the Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/), an eight-week data science fellowship program for training advanced-degree graduates to enter industry.
